# A Project to Predict the Prices of Real Estate

## Introduction :
In today's dynamic real estate market, predicting house prices accurately is crucial for both buyers and sellers.
The House Price Prediction project aims to leverage advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to create a model that can predict house prices based on various features.

# Data Science Concepts Used
* Data Loading and Cleaning:

* Importing necessary libraries.
* Loading and cleaning the dataset.
* Outlier Detection and Removal:

* Identifying and handling outliers.
* Removal of outliers using domain knowledge (e.g., 2bhk price < 3bhk price, size per bhk >= 300 sqft).
* Outlier removal using standard deviation and mean.
* Feature Engineering
* Enhancing the dataset with relevant features.
* Ensuring data accuracy and correctness.
* Checking for duplicate records.
* Data Analysis and Visualization.

* Analyzing and visualizing data patterns.
* Utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation.

# Technology and Tools Used
* Python:

* Primary programming language.
* Libraries: Numpy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

# Steps

* Step #1:
  Import the Required Libraries
  Ensure all necessary Python libraries are imported to facilitate data analysis and machine learning model development.

* Step #2:
  Load the Data
  Load the dataset into the project, preparing it for further analysis.

* Step #3:
  Understand the Data - Drop Unnecessary Columns
  Explore the dataset to gain insights, and drop unnecessary columns that may not contribute to the model.

* Step #4:
  Data Cleaning
  Check for NA Values: 
  Ensure there are no missing values in the dataset.

* Verify Unique Values of Each Column: 
  Validate the uniqueness of values in each column.

* Ensure Values are Correct: 
  Confirm the correctness of data values.

* Feature Engineering: 
  Enhance the dataset with additional features.

* Check for Duplicates: 
  Identify and remove any duplicate records.

* Outlier Removal: 
  Utilize domain knowledge for specific outlier removal.
  Remove outliers using statistical methods, such as standard deviation and mean.

* Encoding: 
  Employ Ordinal and One-Hot encoding techniques to convert categorical variables into numerical format.

# Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing
In this notebook I have tried following things :

* Created few features with the help of existing features , so as to derive more information to feed into the model . I have also created few graphs for data visualization to see how this new features are defining the price of the house
-Creating a variable where a house has both a waterfront and a view -Age of the building - how is is house price related to the age of the building -Whether the house has been renovated : whether house price gets impacted for ever being renovated or not? -If the house has a basement : whether house price gets impacted with having a basement or not? -Size of an average room in sq ft : how is is house price related to the average size of a room

* Created dummy variables for the categorical features.
* A heatmap of the correlation between price and other features is produced to understand which features are highly correlated with price

# Features used for the model
The important features which are used in building models are # of bedrooms, area of the living room, location of the homes in the County, age of the buildings etc. As we have seen from the data exploration, these features have significant importance in terms of pricing of a house and thus can contribute in predicting future house price.
