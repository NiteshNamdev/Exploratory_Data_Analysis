# A Project to Predict the Prices of Real Estate

## Introduction :
In today's dynamic real estate market, predicting house prices accurately is crucial for both buyers and sellers.
The House Price Prediction project aims to leverage advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to create a model that can predict house prices based on various features.

# Data Science Concepts Used
* Data Loading and Cleaning:

* Importing necessary libraries.
* Loading and cleaning the dataset.
* Outlier Detection and Removal:

* Identifying and handling outliers.
* Removal of outliers using domain knowledge (e.g., 2bhk price < 3bhk price, size per bhk >= 300 sqft).
* Outlier removal using standard deviation and mean.
* Feature Engineering
* Enhancing the dataset with relevant features.
* Ensuring data accuracy and correctness.
* Checking for duplicate records.
* Data Analysis and Visualization.

* Analyzing and visualizing data patterns.
* Utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation.

# Technology and Tools Used
* Python:

* Primary programming language.
* Libraries: Numpy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and cleaning.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

# Steps

* Step #1:
  Import the Required Libraries
  Ensure all necessary Python libraries are imported to facilitate data analysis and machine learning model development.

* Step #2:
  Load the Data
  Load the dataset into the project, preparing it for further analysis.

* Step #3:
  Understand the Data - Drop Unnecessary Columns
  Explore the dataset to gain insights, and drop unnecessary columns that may not contribute to the model.

* Step #4:
  Data Cleaning
  Check for NA Values: 
  Ensure there are no missing values in the dataset.

* Verify Unique Values of Each Column: 
  Validate the uniqueness of values in each column.

* Ensure Values are Correct: 
  Confirm the correctness of data values.

* Feature Engineering: 
  Enhance the dataset with additional features.

* Check for Duplicates: 
  Identify and remove any duplicate records.

* Outlier Removal: 
  Utilize domain knowledge for specific outlier removal.
  Remove outliers using statistical methods, such as standard deviation and mean.

* Encoding: 
  Employ Ordinal and One-Hot encoding techniques to convert categorical variables into numerical format.
